Hello!

so basically,

the wine bottle is a larger version of your bottle, (2 Liters)
the corked jug is to provide a version of the jug with a cork inside of it and inline with the rest of the containers (3 liters)
the growler is a big boy jug and will only fit on the top of shelves and in ground storages. (6 - 12 liters)
the carboy is your pre barrel liquid container, and is for large scale corked container recipes, as well as fitting on a single block. (30+ liters or so)

the jug and crock overlays are in \assets\survival\textures\block\clay\overlay
to get larger sized clay and glass containers looking right, we'll need to make overlays for them.
